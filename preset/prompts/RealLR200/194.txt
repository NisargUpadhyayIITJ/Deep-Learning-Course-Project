The image is a black and white photograph of a double-decker bus driving down a street. The bus is quite large and takes up a significant portion of the scene. There are several people on the bus, with some visible through the windows and others standing on the top deck.  In addition to the bus, there are two cars in the scene. One car is located behind the bus on the right side, while the other car is further back on the left side of the street. The presence of these vehicles adds to the overall atmosphere of the busy street.
