The image features a wooden boardwalk or pier extending out into the ocean. The boardwalk is surrounded by tall grass and sand, giving it a serene and natural atmosphere. The ocean is visible in the background, with waves gently rolling in.  There are a few people scattered along the boardwalk, enjoying the view and the peaceful surroundings. Some of them are closer to the water, while others are further back on the boardwalk. Additionally, there is a bicycle parked near the middle of the boardwalk, possibly belonging to one of the visitors.
