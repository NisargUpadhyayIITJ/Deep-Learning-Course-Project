The image depicts a group of four men walking down a city street, each dressed in suits and ties. They are carrying briefcases and backpacks, indicating that they might be professionals or businessmen. The men are walking in a line, with one man slightly ahead of the others.  The street is lined with various bicycles parked on the sidewalk, with some bicycles closer to the foreground and others further back. There are also a few potted plants placed along the street, adding some greenery to the urban environment.
