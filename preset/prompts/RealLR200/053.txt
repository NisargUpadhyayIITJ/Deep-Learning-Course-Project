The image is a black and white photograph of two men sitting on a pier. One man is sitting in a wheelchair, while the other man is sitting in a chair next to him. They are engaged in a conversation, with one man gesturing with his hand.  There is a bench in the background, and a clock can be seen on the wall nearby. The scene appears to be a peaceful and relaxed gathering between the two men.
