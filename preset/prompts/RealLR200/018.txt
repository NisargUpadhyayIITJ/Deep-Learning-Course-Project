The image depicts a busy city street with a large group of people gathered around military tanks. There are at least 14 people visible in the scene, some of them standing close to the tanks, while others are scattered throughout the street. The tanks are positioned in the middle of the street, with one tank located towards the left side and another towards the right side.  In addition to the tanks, there are two cars in the scene, one on the left side and another on the right side of the street. The presence of the military tanks and the crowd of people suggests that this might be a parade or a public event involving the military.
