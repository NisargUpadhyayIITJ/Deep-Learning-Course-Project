The image depicts a group of four men walking down a city street, dressed in suits and ties. They are all carrying briefcases, with one man holding a briefcase in his hand and the other three men wearing briefcases on their shoulders. The men are walking in a line, with one man slightly ahead of the others.  The street is lined with various objects, including a bicycle parked on the left side of the scene, a potted plant near the center, and a car parked further down the street. There are also a couple of handbags visible in the scene, one near the center and the other closer to the right side.
