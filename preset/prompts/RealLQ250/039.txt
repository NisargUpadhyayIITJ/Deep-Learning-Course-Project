The image is a black and white photograph of a large, ornate building with a clock tower. The building has a prominent clock on its side, and it appears to be a hotel. There are several people standing outside the building, with some of them closer to the foreground and others further back.  In addition to the people, there are two cars parked in front of the building, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The scene captures the essence of a busy city street with people going about their daily activities.
