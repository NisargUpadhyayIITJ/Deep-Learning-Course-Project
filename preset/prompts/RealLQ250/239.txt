The image features a large, old building with a clock tower, which appears to be a church. The building is made of brick and has a tall, pointed structure. The clock tower is located at the top of the building, making it a prominent feature.  There are two people in the scene, one standing near the left side of the building and the other closer to the center. Additionally, there is a car parked in front of the building, slightly to the left. The overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat gloomy, with the old building and the presence of the clock tower giving it a historical and solemn feel.
