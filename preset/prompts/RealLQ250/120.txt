The image is a black and white photograph of two men sitting on a pier. One man is sitting in a wheelchair, while the other man is sitting next to him. They are both engaged in a conversation, with the man in the wheelchair gesturing with his hand.  There are several chairs in the scene, with one chair being occupied by the man in the wheelchair, and another chair placed nearby. The other chairs are scattered around the pier, with one chair located further back in the scene. The men appear to be enjoying their time together, despite the challenges that the man in the wheelchair may face.
