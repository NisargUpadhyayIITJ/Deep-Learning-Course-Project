The image features a large white boat docked next to a building in a city. The boat is situated on the water, and it appears to be a prominent part of the scene. There are several people scattered around the area, some of them standing near the boat, while others are closer to the building.  In addition to the boat and people, there are a few umbrellas visible in the scene. One umbrella is located near the left side of the image, another is in the middle, and the third one is on the right side. The presence of these umbrellas suggests that the area might be a popular spot for outdoor activities or gatherings.
