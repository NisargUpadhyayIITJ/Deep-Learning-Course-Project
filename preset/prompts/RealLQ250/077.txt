The image features a large airplane parked on a runway, with its cargo hold open. Several people are standing around the airplane, possibly working on loading or unloading cargo. There are at least nine people visible in the scene, with some standing closer to the airplane and others further away.  In addition to the airplane, there are two trucks in the scene, one located near the left side of the image and the other on the right side. The trucks might be used for transporting cargo to and from the airplane.
