The image features a stack of books, with one book on top of the other. The top book is written in a foreign language, possibly Chinese, and has a blue cover. The bottom book is written in English and has a gold cover. The books are placed on a table, and the arrangement creates a contrast between the two languages and the different colors of the covers.
